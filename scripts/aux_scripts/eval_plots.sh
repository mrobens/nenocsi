# This shell script creates three different kinds of plots: A boxplot of latencies
# and a heatmap of routed events for each acceleration factor as well as a
# "maximum delay vs. acceleration factor" plot to assess network performance.
#
# Note: This script needs to receive McAERsim's binary directory as first parameter,
#       the network topology as second parameter and the network dimensions as third
#       parameter
