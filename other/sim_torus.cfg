% NENoCSi: Patched version of Noxim to process traffic generated by NEST

% 2023-02-01: This file has been adapted to override some settings in config.yaml
%             that are specific to traffic caused by NEST. Except for the use of
%             the torus topology, parameters are similar - but still different -
%             to those in sim_mesh.cfg contained in the "other" directory of the
%             original download.
